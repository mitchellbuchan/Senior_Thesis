# Senior_Thesis
This repository houses my Senior Thesis, completed during Fall Quarter of 2020 under my advisor Dr. Carlos Flores. My thesis, titled "Are Pharmaceutical Profits Excessive? Assessing the Relationship between Profit, Industry, and Research & Development" attempts to discern both if the pharmaceutical industry has higher profits and if they are justifiable through R&D expenses and other factors. The Thesis_Rcode.R file contains the code I used for the data management and analysis utilized in the thesis, and pdata.csv is the data that was used, so that my results are easily replicable for anyone who is interested.
